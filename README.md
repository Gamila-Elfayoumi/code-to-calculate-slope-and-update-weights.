# code-to-calculate-slope-and-update-weights.
Variables:
1- weights is a NumPy array of the weights of the linear regression model.
2- input_data is a NumPy array of the input data.
3- traget is the target value.
4- learning_rate is the learning rate of the gradient descent algorithm.
Predictions calculation of the model:
preds = (weights * input_data).sum()
Error calculation of the model:
error = preds - traget
The gradient of the error with respect to the weights calculations(slope):
gradient = 2 * input_data * error
Updates the weights of the model using the gradient descent algorithm with this calculations:
weights_update = weights - learning_rate * gradient
Update the predictions calculation of the model:
preds_update = (weights_update * input_data).sum()
The new error calculation of the model:
error_update = preds_update - traget
